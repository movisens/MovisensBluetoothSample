# Movisens Bluetooth Example Project

The following showcases the connection between a smartphone and movisens physiological sensors via Bluetooth. It implements the data flows connecting to a movisens sensor and remains connected over a long time even accounting for dropouts.

The project contains a way to find movisens sensors nearby and to connect to them. It uses the data flows described in the chapter [Connection data flows](#dataflows).

An Android foreground service runs the sensing in the background and reconnects when a sensor disconnects. In order to safely reconnect we implement the reconnect logic via a [setAlarmClock](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setAlarmClock(android.app.AlarmManager.AlarmClockInfo,%2520android.app.PendingIntent))  mechanism. This allows a prompt reconnect even when the smartphone operates on a newer Android phone with version 7 or higher and uses doze mode.

## How to connect to a movisens sensor

This chapter describes the necessary requirements and which data flows to follow in order to connect to a movisens sensor and hold your connection without issues.

### Prerequisites
- movisens ECG, EDA or Move sensor
    - Generation 3 or higher
- At least firmware version 1.12.0

### Connection data flows <a name="dataflows"></a>

The optimisation of our sensors for mobile research requires you to implement a few data flows in order to get a stable, non-faulty connection with no data loss.

#### First connection

 >**WARNING**: Be careful when deleting all data! If the data wasn't downloaded via the [SensorManager](https://www.movisens.com/en/sensormanager/), you permanently lose the recorded data. Never continue a measurement which is currently running via a fresh first start. If you activate different characteristics via indication than before, the sensor wonâ€™t transmit any data.

#### Restart connection (After an app or smartphone restart)

![alt text](https://docs.movisens.com/bluetooth-example/Restart.png "First Connection Graph")

 >**WARNING**: Be careful to never restart a connection after measurement enabled returns **false** and data is available returns  **true**. If this occurs, the sensor ceases data transmission.
